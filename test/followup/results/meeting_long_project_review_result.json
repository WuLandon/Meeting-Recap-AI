    "email": "Subject: Follow-Up: Quarterly Project Review\n\nHi team,\n\nThank you for your participation in our recent quarterly project review. We covered significant progress across backend infrastructure, UX redesign, and customer onboarding optimization, noting a 15% improvement in latency and a 10% increase in user onboarding completion from the previous sprint. Our discussion also focused on refining backend caching, expanding A/B tests for the signup flow, establishing clearer ownership for cross-functional dependencies, and reviewing customer feedback to improve in-app guidance and error handling.\n\n**Key Decisions**\n• Implement caching improvements for user data retrieval by end of month.\n• Roll out the second phase of the onboarding A/B test starting next sprint.\n• Reassign ownership of the customer onboarding flow to the Growth team.\n\n**Action Items**\n• Elias — Profile and optimize caching layer for user endpoints by next Friday.\n• Harper — Design updated onboarding variation for A/B testing by Thursday.\n• Zoey, Mateo — Prepare customer feedback summary for leadership review by Tuesday.\n• Quinn — Implement error handling improvements in the setup process.\n• Avery — Plan cross-team sync on Growth ownership transfer by next Monday.\n\n**Next Meeting:** Wednesday 3 PM\n\nThanks for everyone’s contributions and continued focus on these key initiatives.\n\nBest,"
