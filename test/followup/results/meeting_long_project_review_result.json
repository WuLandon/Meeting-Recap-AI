    "email": "Subject: Recap: Quarterly Project Review\n\nHi team,\n\nThanks for a really productive quarterly project review today. It was great to go over the progress across our backend infrastructure, UX redesign, and customer onboarding optimization workstreams. We saw some solid improvements in latency and user onboarding completion, which is fantastic! We also had a good discussion on refining our caching logic, expanding A/B tests for the signup flow, and clarifying ownership, especially after reviewing the valuable customer feedback from our beta release.\n\n**Key Decisions**\n• We'll implement caching improvements for user data retrieval by the end of the month.\n• The second phase of our onboarding A/B test will roll out starting next sprint.\n• Ownership of the customer onboarding flow will be reassigned to the Growth team.\n\n**Action Items**\n• Elias — Profile and optimize caching layer for user endpoints (due Next Friday)\n• Harper — Design updated onboarding variation for A/B testing (due Thursday)\n• Zoey & Mateo — Prepare customer feedback summary for leadership review (due Tuesday)\n• Quinn — Implement error handling improvements in the setup process\n• Avery — Plan cross-team sync on Growth ownership transfer (due Next Monday)\n\n**Next Meeting:** Wednesday 3 PM\n\nAppreciate everyone's insights and hard work on these initiatives. Let's keep the momentum going!\nBest,\n[Your Name]"
